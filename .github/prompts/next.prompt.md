# FEATURE 1: Stable card layout
- Once a card is laid into the board, it will maintain its position on the 4x3 grid
- this is to make it easier for the player to create a visual map in their mind
- a card will only ever be removed from the board in two situations:
    1: after being selected as part of a valid set 
    2: after being burned as part of a valid set following an incorrect "no set" assertion by the player
- new cards will be dealt into open gaps only, and will never affect the position of existing cards
