# SPEC: Consolidate game modes underlying logic
- presently this game uses two different modes 
- both of these modes should remain as options for the player to play and experience
- however, the underlying logic of these modes should be the same
- rogue mode
    - rogue mode is played through a progressive set of rounds, where the rules change each time
    - each round has a customizable set of rules, including card attributes and board size
    - the game ends when there are no more round left to play
- classic mode
    - classic mode is one round with classic set rules
    - classic mode should use all the same functions and logic as rogue mode with the following conditions
        - one round only
        - the round definition is the equivalent of classic set
- by ensuring classic mode is effectively a 1 round special case of rogue mode, we can use the same logic to control the flow of the game
- in particular, classic mode should use the same functions to detect round end, and therefore game end
- presently, classic mode never ends.  This is a bug that should be fixed by this spec.
