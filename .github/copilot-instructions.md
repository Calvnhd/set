- if reading from a prompt file you must check for the section heading "FEATURE <number>"
- if feature number headings are present, you MUST implement these features in the order specified from lowest to highest
- treat low number features as highest priority
- treat a feature as dependent on all features with a lower number
- do not begin designing or implementing a subsequent feature until all previous features are implemented
- do not begin designing or implementing a subsequent feature until I give approval
- follow the feature spec very closely.  If you believe a better approach is possible or wish to tweak or clarify parts of the spec, ask for my approval first.
